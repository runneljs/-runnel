# @runnel/validator

This library is designed for [Runnel](https://docs.runnel.run/). Please visit [our documentation](https://docs.runnel.run/) and learn more.

For a default pre-built validator, use [@runnel/validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@runnel/validator). It depends on [@cfworker/json-schema](https://github.com/cfworker/cfworker/blob/main/packages/json-schema/README.md) for validating payloads with JSON schema.
